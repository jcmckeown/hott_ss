The initial author, who is indebted to the [HoTT team](https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT), assures any user that he wrote
all the code present himself; but not that it isn't redundant, or that it is particularly original.  He nonetheless
*hopes* it will be useful, and doesn't mind anyone adapting it for mathematical or scientific purposes.

IF you find it useful, do please credit your source, and let me know.
