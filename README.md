### SemiSimplicial types in Homotopy Type Theory

+ Nat --- a collection of useful arithmetic tools and THE homotopical fact about the type nat
+ nCk --- the finite intervals and the binomial types ; while every finite type "is" equivalent
to a finite interval, structured presentations of the binomial types are much more useful. These
sets are hsets.
+ ordmap --- the strictly ordered maps of the finite intervals admit a composition that is 
strictly associative; the binomial types are an hset retract of the ordered map types.
+ nCkList --- ordered lists and binomial lists. These types are retracts of dependent functions
on lists and on binomial types, but homotopies of dependent functions descend to *equations* of
ordered/binomial lists!
+ FunctionRels --- the domain projection from the graph of a function is an equivalence; this characterizes
the graphs of functions among all graphs; a function is determined up to homotopy by its graph.
+ SSimplicial (coming soon!) --- coloured semisimplicial types.
